# Neovim [NVChad](https://nvchad.com/) config
## My ultimate Neovim/NVChad config 
 **This repo is my personal config for NvChad!**

- This is my main nvchad config that I update occassionally based on my preferences.
- You can fork this repo and make changes but as of rn, it has most of the plugins that you'll need as a dev.
