# Neovim [NVChad](https://nvchad.com/) config

> [!Note]
> **This repo includes my config for NvChad!**

- This is my main nvchad config that I update occassionally based on my preferences.
- You can fork this repo and make changes but as of rn, it has most of the plugins that you'll need as a dev.
